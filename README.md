<p>AlgoViz is a Web based online platform shall serve the purpose of providing its users (Educators/Students) with an enriched documentary of algorithms alongside their graphical visualization. Also, it shall possess an interactive IDE which alongside the algorithm and its visualization shall propose its code in a specific programming language. This would give the user the freedom of manipulating with the code and having a hands-on experience of what the results after this change would look like.</p>

### ABSTRACT
<p style="text-align: center;">Algorithms are formulas or methods for solving a problem. They serve their purpose by executing a sequence of finite steps until a result is achieved. So, algorithms are basically a sequence of carefully planned and documented steps. Problem-solving is much more efficient and with the vast variety of algorithms to choose from every userâ€™s needs are satisfied according to their different form of data. As mentioned, a large amount of algorithms have been developed over the course of its advent and no matter however much easier they make our tasks happen, their understanding is very complex with no good form of visualization technique present. Every algorithm is eventually written/represented in the form of pseudo code which is just interpretation of steps of the algorithm in a recognized language like English which can be understood at a glance but it may be time consuming, or an algorithm may be in the form of code written in some high-level programming language which can be much harder to understand. So, in order to make the learning process of algorithms easier multiple techniques like flow-charts, animations and have been used by instructors and students from time to time. Multiple websites provide an enriched documentation of algorithms and their pictorial representation and some other proved step by step visualization. But, still most of them lack in features like for instance if big data is provided or data for the problem is changed or incorporation of complex algorithms for their visualization such as Greedy algorithms etc. This Web based online platform shall serve the purpose of providing its users (Educators/Students) with an enriched documentary of algorithms alongside their graphical visualization. Also, it shall possess an interactive IDE which alongside the algorithm and its visualization shall propose its code in a specific programming language. This would give the user the freedom of manipulating with the code and having a hands-on experience of what the results after this change would look like.</p>
